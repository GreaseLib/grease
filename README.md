### Getting Started

Sertain is still in pre-release, but you can use the latest version by adding this to your gradle build script:

```gradle
repositories {
  // other repositories
  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
  // other dependencies
  implementation 'com.github.SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam:org.sert2521.sertain:0.0.7'
}
```

You can also replace the any commit on master, and you can replace `0.0.7` with `any-branch-SNAPSHOT`. You can also use a commit hash as the version without a branch name.

### Creating a Robot Program
To create a robot program, start by using the `robot` function. The function takes a lambda, which should serve as the entry point of the robot program. For example:

```kotlin
suspend fun main() = robot {
  // Your code goes here
}
```

### Coroutines

Note that this library is built using coroutines. However, the RoboRIO only has access to two threads, so if you should need to create a global coroutine, you need to use `RobotScope` as the coroutine scope. `RobotScope` can be accessed through the `robot` block. Follow this example:

```kotlin
robot {
  launch {
    // Global coroutine code here
  }
}
```

### Events

It is also possible to subscribe to events. Events are the core component of sertain, and run almost everything. To create an event, do:

```kotlin
class MyEvent : Event
```

Then subscribe to the event by calling `subscribe`, like so:

```kotlin
subscribe<MyEvent> {
  // Code to run when event is fired
}
```

Finally, fire the event using `fire`:

```kotlin
fire(MyEvent())
```
Keep in mind that `subscribe` behaves like `launch`. It returns a `Job`, so you can use functions like `cancel` and `join` on it.

Sertain also provides pre-defined event subscribers. Event subscribers simply wrap the `subscribe` function for a specific type of event. For instance, `onEnable` subscribes to the `Enable` event, like so:

```kotlin
onEnable {
  // Code to run when the event occures.
}
```

### Subsystems

Subsystems represent different components of the robot. A subsystem should only preform one task at a time. If you need to run more than one task, then you should probably be using two different subsystems. To create a subsystem, extend the `Subsystem` class.

```kotlin
class MySubsystem : Subsystem("My Subsystem") {
  // Subsystem code goes here
}
```

There are several ways to use subsystems, but this guide will only cover one. To register a subsystem, just call `register` and you can get the subsystem's `Accessor`. It's easy! Just do this:

```kotlin
val mySubsystem = register<MySubsystem>()
```
 
You can assign tasks to subsystems by calling `use`. Inside the block, you can get instances of your subsystems in the order they are passed into use. The block should contain the code that you want to run. Use this example:

```kotlin
use(mySubsystem, myOtherSubsystem) { mySubsystem, myOtherSubsystem ->
  // code goes here
}
```

Additionaly, if your command only uses one subsystem, you can just call your subsystem like a function instead. Follow this example:

```kotlin
mySubsystem { mySubsystem ->
  // code goes here
}
```

Note that one task can be assigned to multiple subsystems, and that susystems can only do one task at a time. If you try to assign a task to an already occupied subsystem, the previous task will be replaced by the new one. Also note that because a task is a coroutine that is cancelled once it is finished, they can be used in combination with event subscribers to subscribe only for the duration of the task.
